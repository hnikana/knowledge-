    "# How __init__ and __main__ work\n",
    "    Names that start and end with double underscores, often called 'dunders', are special names in Python. Two of them are special names related to modules and packages: __init__ and __main__. Depending on whether you are organizing your code as a package or a module, they are treated slightly differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We will look at the difference between a module and a package in a moment, but the main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    When you import a package it runs the __init__.py file inside the package directory.\n",
    "    When you execute a package (e.g. python -m my_package) it executes the __main__.py file.\n",
    "    When you import a module it runs the entire file from top to bottom.\n",
    "    When you execute a module ir runs the entire file from top-to-bottom and sets the __name__ variable to the string \"__main__\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Directory structure of my_package/\n",
    "    my_package/\n",

    "    my_package/__main__.py\n",
    "    my_package/some_other_module.py\n",
    "    \n",
    "    If a package is invoked directly (e.g. python -m my_package), the __main__.py module is executed. The __init__.py file is executed when a package is imported (e.g. import my_package).\n",
    "    IN A MODULE\n",
    "    In the previous section, we saw how a package can have separate files for __init__.py and __main__.py. In a module (a single .py file) the equivalent of __init__ and __main__ are contained in the single file. The entire itself essentially becomes both the __init__.py and the __main__.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "    When a module is imported, it runs the whole file, loading any functions defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "    When a module is invoked directly, for example, python my_module.py or python -m my_module, then it does the same thing as importing it, but also sets the __name__ variable to the string \"__main__\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can take advantage of this and execute a section of code only if the module is invoked directly, and not when it is imported. To do this, you need to explicitly check the __name__ variable, and see if it equals __main__. If it is set to the string __main__, then you know the module was invoked directly, and not simply imported.\n",
