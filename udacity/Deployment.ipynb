    "\n",
    "+ Model is coded in Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) or Portable Format Analytics (PFA).\n",
    "    - The second method is to code the model in Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) or Portable Format for Analytics (PFA), which are two complementary standards that simplify moving predictive models to deployment into a production environment. The Data Mining Group developed both PMML and PFA to provide vendor-neutral executable model specifications for certain predictive models used by data mining and machine learning. Certain analytic software allows for the direct import of PMML including but not limited to IBM SPSS, R, SAS Base & Enterprise Miner, Apache Spark, Teradata Warehouse Miner, and TIBCO Spotfire.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Python model is converted into a format that can be used in the production environment. \n",
    "        \n",
    "    - The third method is to build a Python model and use libraries and methods that convert the model into code that can be used in the production environment. Specifically most popular machine learning software frameworks, like PyTorch, TensorFlow, SciKit-Learn, have methods that will convert Python models into intermediate standard format, like ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange format). This intermediate standard format then can be converted into the software native to the production environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "        * This is the easiest and fastest way to move a Python model from modeling directly to deployment.\n",
    "        * Moving forward this is typically the way models are moved into the production environment.\n",

    "# Deployment within Machine Learning Curriculum\n",
    "Deployment is not commonly included in machine learning curriculum. This likely is associated with the analyst's typical focus on Exploring and Processing Data and Modeling, and the software developer's focusing more on Deployment and the production environment. Advances in cloud services, like SageMaker and ML Engine, and deployment technologies, like Containers and REST APIs, allow for analysts to easily take on the responsibilities of deployment.\n"

    "# Characteristics of Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Versioning\n",
    "    One characteristic of deployment is the version of the model that is to be deployed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Besides saving the model version as a part of a model’s metadata in a database, the deployment platform should allow one to indicate a deployed model’s version.This will make it easier to maintain, monitor, and update the deployed model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Monitoring\n",
    "    Another characteristic of deployment is the ability to easily monitor your deployed models.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Once a model is deployed you will want to make certain it continues to meet its performance metrics; otherwise, the application may need to be updated with a better performing model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Model Updating and Routing\n",
    "    The ability to easily update your deployed model is another characteristic of deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If a deployed model is failing to meet its performance metrics, it's likely you will need to update this model.\n",
    "    If there's been a fundamental change in the data that’s being input into the model for predictions; you'll want to collect this input data to be used to update the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The deployment platform should support routing differing proportions of user requests to the deployed models; to allow comparison of performance between the deployed model variants.\n",
    "    Routing in this way allows for a test of a model performance as compared to other model variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Predictions\n",
    "    Another characteristic of deployment is the type of predictions provided by your deployed model. There are two common types of predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On-demand predictions\n",
    "2. Batch predictions\n",
    "### On-Demand Predictions\n",
    "    On-demand predictions might also be called:\n",
    "        1. online,\n",
    "        2. real-time, or synchronous predictions\n",
    "        \n",
    "    With these type of predictions, one expects:\n",
    "        a low latency of response to each prediction request,\n",
    "        but allows for possibility high variability in request volume.\n",
    "        Predictions are returned in the response from the request. Often these requests and responses are done through an API using JSON or XML formatted strings.\n",
    "        Each prediction request from the user can contain one or many requests for predictions. Noting that many is limited based upon the size of the data sent as the request. Common cloud platforms on-demand prediction request size limits can range from 1.5(ML Engine) to 5 Megabytes (SageMaker).\n",
    "        On-demand predictions are commonly used to provide customers, users, or employees with real-time, online responses based upon a deployed model. Thinking back on our magic eight ball web application example, users of our web application would be making on-demand prediction requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch Predictions\n",
    "    Batch predictions might also be called:\n",
    "        asynchronous, or\n",
    "        batch-based predictions.\n",
    "    With these type of predictions, one expects:\n",
    "        high volume of requests with more periodic submissions , so latency won’t be an issue.\n",
    "        Each batch request will point to specifically formatted data file of requests and will return the predictions to a file. Cloud services require these files will be stored in the cloud provider’s cloud.\n",
    "        Cloud services typically have limits to how much data they can process with each batch request based upon limits they impose on the size of file you can store in their cloud storage service. For example, Amazon’s SageMaker limits batch predictions requests to the size limit they enforce on an object in their S3 storage service.\n",
    "        Batch predictions are commonly used to help make business decisions. For example, imagine a business uses a complex model to predict customer satisfaction across a number of their products and they need these estimates for a weekly report. This would require processing customer data through a batch prediction request on a weekly basis.\n",
